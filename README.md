NC vs SC population growth: A webcraping project comparing population grown in North and South Carolina
Wikipedia was selected due to its scraping policy and data avaiability
While this project leverages the foundational scraping techniques from the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, it extends the scope by performing multi-source data merging and implementing a custom cleaning pipeline to handle real-world Wikipedia HTML inconsistencies.

Tools Used: 
* Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
* Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup4, Requests
* Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib

🛠️ Technical Highlights: Used BeautifulSoup to responsibly scrape data from Wikipedia, manually built dataframes from html, designed dataframe cleaning function

💡 Key Insight: The 1970 divergence coincides with the "Sun Belt" migration and the maturation of the Research Triangle Park in NC. While SC maintained a steady growth through manufacturing, NC's pivot toward high-growth finance (Charlotte) and tech (Raleigh) sectors created an exponential population trajectory.
